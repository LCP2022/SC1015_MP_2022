# **Prediction of Heart Failure DataSet Analysis** 

## About
  > This is a Miniproject for SC1015 (introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence)
    which focuses on predicting [Heart failure from the Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)  
      
 > - For more detail you can look at the video [SC1015 video.mp4]  
 > - Information Finding you can look at [Final_Dataset.ipynb]  
    
    
## Probelm Definition
> - How do we predict if a person might have the probability of heart failure?  
> - Can we predict based on a single factor? If no why? If yes how?
> - What the relationship between factor vs heart failure?
> - Which could be a main factor for having heart failure?

## Model Used
> - Decision Tree
> - Random Forest
> - Artifical Neural Network

## Conclusion
> - Predictor features : age, cholestrol, Heart Rate & Blood pressure
> - It is impossible to predict base on one features as our body conditions could show different type of diseases that a human have. Different diseases such as diabetes have similar symptoms such as  cholesterol level.
> - Thus using the 4 other features, we are able to increase our prediction probability of a person having heart disease/failure.
## What did we learn form this project?
> - Learnt new models 
>   - ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
>   - Randon Forest
> - Analytical Thinking
>   - More than one factor for us to predict a person having heart failure/disease. Essential information such as heart rate, age, blood pressure are also a strong contributor for the prediction.
